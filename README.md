### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

### What I learned

- Using `.value.trim()` deletes white spaces
- test() check if a string contain a match
- `e.preventDefault();` prevent for submitting by default action that normally associated with an event

### Continued development

- I would like to know more about:

```js
.addEventListener("", (e) => {
  // instruction
})
```
